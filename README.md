Abstract
Use YNAT dataset and develop topic classification algorithm.
Preprocess text data through translating(KOR -> ENG), backtranslating(ENG -> KOR) and removing stopwords
Use bidirectional LSTM, KLUE-Roberta-large model, and control optimizer, learning rate to find the optimal model.
Modeling
Bidirectional LSTM
KLUE-Roberta
